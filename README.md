# Flow_trace_back
## Main code: Flow trace-back algorithm-v3.ipynb
## Input data file: NetworkFlowProblem-Data.xlsx (keep in the same folder directory of main code).
## Output data files: 
### (1) Flow_tracebacks_Input1, Flow_tracebacks_Input2, Flow_tracebacks_Input3, Flow_tracebacks_Input4, Flow_tracebacks_Input5, Flow_tracebacks_Input6
### (2) Flow_path_DFS_Input1, Flow_path_DFS_Input2, Flow_path_DFS_Input3, Flow_path_DFS_Input4, Flow_path_DFS_Input5, Flow_path_DFS_Input6
## Network flow tracebacks are implemented using (1) backtracking and (2) DFS algorithms.
### Backtracking (Flow_traceback) is a more complete version. DFS algorithm (DFS_path_traceback) is not yet complete.
